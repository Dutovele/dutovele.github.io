# dutovele.github.io
This is my first project using HTML, CSS, JS. It is a website I created for a friend of mine for her bakery start-up.

This is my first training project. 
In order get inspiration and training to complete this project I watched many tutorials on YouTube from many popular experienced programmers. 

This project contains index.html file as the main page, contact.html file as the contact form, styles.css as file to provide the design and wapp.js as a short JavaScript function file I learned in order to manage the mobile menu. 

All the pictures used in this project belong to my friend Armina Abagyan, on Instagram - @arminaabagyan 

Armine Abagyan, @arminaabagyan has the absolute right to use and modify the contents of this website from now on.
